AltGr-WEur-Mac
==============

https://altgr-weur.eu/

This layout makes all accented characters used in Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portugese, Spanish and Swedish available through one AltGr keystroke.

The Mac implementation was forked from [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts, changing the `AltGr` key sets to match `weur`'s proposal.

**Status**: New version built from Ukelele, should match almost all the keys from the original layout


Install
=======

If using Homebrew, there is a Cask for you:

`brew install altgr-weur`

If you want to install manually or just for your user, follow the instructions below:

Copy the two files `altgr-weur.keylayout` and `altgr-weur.icns` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred though to ensure the layout is available to all applications. (See also [this Superuser answer](https://superuser.com/a/561613/263461).)
