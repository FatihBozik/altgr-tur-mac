AltGr-WEur-Mac
==============

https://altgr-weur.eu/

This was forked from [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts, changing the `AltGr` keys to match `weur`'s proposal.

**Status**: Adapter from EurKEY layout manually


Install
=======

Copy the two files `altgr-weur.keylayout` and `altgr-weur.icns` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred though to ensure the layout is available to all applications. (See also [this Superuser answer](https://superuser.com/a/561613/263461).)
